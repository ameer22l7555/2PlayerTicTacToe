## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

     - **Windows**: Tkinter is included by default.
     - **Ubuntu**: Run `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.
     - **macOS**: Tkinter is included, but if needed, install it via Homebrew with `brew install python-tk`.

2. **Running the Game**:
   - Clone this repository or download the `tic_tac_toe.py` file.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python tic_tac_toe.py
     ```

## Features

- **Score Tracking**: Displays the number of wins for each player ('X' and 'O') and the number of draws.
- **Turn Indicator**: Shows whose turn it is ('X' or 'O') at the top of the game window.
- **New Game Button**: Allows players to manually start a new game after each round.
- **Color-Coded Moves**: 'X' moves are displayed in blue, and 'O' moves in red for better visual distinction.
- **Visual Grid Lines**: A gray background with padding creates a professional grid layout.
- **Button State Management**: Buttons are disabled after being clicked to prevent invalid moves, and all buttons are disabled when the game ends.

## How to Play

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The objective is to be the first to place three of your symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. If the grid is filled without any player achieving this, the game ends in a draw.

- **Player 'X'** starts the game.
- Players alternate turns by clicking on empty grid spaces.
- The game ends when a player wins or the grid is full (draw).
- Use the "New Game" button to start a new round.
